                <h3>Contrast</h3>
                <p>Philippine Airlines</p>
                <a href="https://www.philippineairlines.com/en/ph/home" target="_blank">philippineairlines.com</a>
                <img src="images/pal.jpg" alt="Philippine Airlines Website">
                <p>The designer implemented the principle of contrast for the airline’s website. From the colors, the white font standing clearly on the blue background. Conversely, the dark font also standing out on the white background of the main section of the page. It makes the audience easily read the headings and body type.
                    <br><br>Different sizes of the font contrast with each other. The user will immediately recognize sections of the website. However, the designer only uses a sans-serif font which it is not contrasting, but websites are degned that way.

                <h3>Alignment</h3>
                <p>CNN Philippines</p>
                <a href="https://www.cnnphilippines.com/" target="_blank">cnnphilippines.com</a>
                <img src="images/cnn.jpg" alt="CNN Philippines Website">
                <p>All you can see with the CNN Philippines’ website is the elements of the page are perfectly aligned. It makes the design more clean and organized. The logo, headings, and the body type are all left aligned.
                    <br><br>On the main section, the items are both left and right aligned. The padding on both sides are equal.
                </p>

                <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>
                <p>Garb Athletics</p>
                <a href="http://www.garbathletics.com/" target="_blank">garbathletics.com</a>
                <img src="images/garbathletics.jpg" alt="Garb Athletics Website">
                <p>Elements on websites which are the same type are in equal sizes and shapes. Garb athletics exemplified how hierarchy of the items control the vision of their audience by setting the elements on various sizes. The tool to create customize uniform is the largest item on the page. Second, the video showing their products. Third, the text that says, “All-Inclusive Uniforms”. Fourth, the logo of the company. Fifth, the category or menu bar to view more options.
                    <br><br>Depending on different sizes of the item, you can direct the users where to point their attention using the visual hierarchy principle.
